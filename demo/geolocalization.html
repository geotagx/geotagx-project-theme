		<h2>How to geolocalize an image</h2>
		<h4>Locating a region</h4>
		<p>
			If you are unsure of the region where the photo was taken, we recommended perusing the
			source article for any hints. If you do find the name of the location where the photo
			was taken, you can use <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.15em"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-search"></i></button>
			(the Search tool) to quickly zoom in on it.
		</p>
		<h4>Changing the view mode</h4>
		<p>
			By default, you are presented with a map view that may not be useful in cases where you would
			like to have a clearer view of the terrain. In these instances, it is possible to switch to either satellite
			imagery with <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.35em"><strong>S</strong></button> (the Satellite Imagery toggle)
			or aerial imagery with <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.35em"><strong>A</strong></button>
			(the Aerial Imagery toggle). The downside to both satellite and aerial views is that imagery data may not always
			be available. While this is particularly apparent for satellite imagery, in almost all cases, aerial imagery
			can be used as a complement. In other words, try switching to the aerial view when no satellite imagery is available.<br>
			To switch back to the map view, you can use <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.35em"><strong>M</strong></button>
			(the Map View toggle).
		</p>
		<h4>Selecting an area of interest</h4>
		<p>
			Once you have located an area you would like to geolocalize, the goal is to draw an outline around it
			as accurately as possible. To begin, start by clicking a point on the map to toggle draw mode.
			This mode will allow you to draw a polygon around your area of interest. To finish drawing, you can
			either double-click the last point of the outline, or click its first point to close the loop.<br><br>
			Please remember that only one outline can be drawn at a time. If the process is restarted, any
			existing polygons will be deleted.<br>You can also remove any drawings by
			using <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.15em"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-eraser"></i></button> (the Eraser tool).
		</p>
		<h4>Full-screen mode</h4>
		<p>
			If your viewport is too small, you can switch to full-screen with <button disabled class="btn btn-primary" style="padding:0 0.25em"><big>&#8596;</big></button>
			(the Full-screen toggle). This tool is not available if your browser does not support full-screen mode!
